# Commands

> Status: implemented command surface. Output is compact by default to stay
> low-token.

Each command maps 1:1 to an addon tool and sends a single JSON request to the
selected editor instance.

| Command | Tool | Status | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| `status` | `status` | ☑ | Show the connected editor: project path, Godot version, active scene, Game Feel UI Mode state, and Game Feel Mode state. |
| `run [--scene <res://...>] [--current] [--wait]` | `run` | ☑ | Play the main scene (default), the current scene (`--current`), or a specific scene (`--scene`). `--wait` polls until the matching runtime scene is inspectable. |

| `classdb constants <Class> [--own]` | `classdb` | ☑ | List ClassDB integer constants with values and enum membership when available. Includes inherited constants by default; `--own` limits output to the class itself. |
| `classdb enums <Class> [--own]` | `classdb` | ☑ | List ClassDB enums and their integer constants. Includes inherited enums by default; `--own` limits output to the class itself. |
| `classdb inherits <Class> <BaseClass>` | `classdb` | ☑ | Check inheritance using Godot ClassDB. |
| `game tree` | `game` | ☑ | Print the running game's live node tree. Requires a play session and the Hera runtime autoload; requests are isolated to the matching game process. |
| `game ui tree [--path <node>] [--depth N] [--fields <a,b>] [--type <Class>] [--text <label>]` | `game` | ☑ | Print live `Control` nodes. Scope by subtree, depth, class, exact text, and returned fields (`name,path,type,visible,rect,text,disabled,pressed`) for low-token UI QA before semantic clicks. |
| `game instances` | `game` | ☑ | List Hera runtime game processes seen by the editor, including pid, scene, and heartbeat age. Useful for stale process diagnosis. |
| `game screenshot [--path <p>] [--analyze]` | `game` | ☑ | Capture the running game viewport to PNG and return the path. `--analyze` adds generic image/layout metrics (`nonblank`, dimensions, sampled color count, brightness, edge content by side, clipping and low-detail hints). |
| `game click --x N --y N` / `game click --node <path>` / `game click --text <label>` | `game` | ☑ | Send a left mouse click to the running game viewport. `--node` and `--text` target the center of a live `Control`, avoiding brittle pixel coordinates. Runtime-only and useful for surface-level QA. |
| `game input mouse --x N --y N --button left\|right\|middle --press\|--release\|--click [--modifiers shift,ctrl]` | `game` | ☑ | Inject a runtime mouse input event and record it in the input diagnostic log. Separate `--press` and `--release` calls, with `wait`, let QA prove long-click behavior. |
| `game input key --key KEY_W --press\|--release [--physical] [--modifiers shift,ctrl]` / `game input action <name> --press\|--release` / `game input text <text>` | `game` | ☑ | Inject keyboard, InputMap action, or text input events for direct gameplay QA. Key events default to `Input.parse_input_event`; `--route viewport` sends them through the viewport when focused Controls need key events. |
| `game input-log [--limit N] [--clear]` | `game` | ☑ | Read the runtime input diagnostic log: click coordinates, button, press/release, short/long classification, key names, modifiers, active keys, and active mouse buttons. |
| `game node get <path> [--prop <name>\|--props <a,b>]` | `game` | ☑ | Dump a live runtime node's editor-visible properties, or selected properties for low-token QA. Selected names may use dotted paths such as `player.position` or `state.score`. Absolute paths like `/root/Main` are accepted. |
| `game node set <path> --prop <name> --value <v>` | `game` | ☑ | Set a live runtime node property. Runtime-only, not undoable, and lost when play stops. |
| `game node call <path> <method> [--arg <v> ...]` | `game` | ☑ | Call a live runtime node method and return the stringified result. Runtime-only and may have side effects. |
| `game assert <path> <prop> <eq\|ne\|contains\|gt\|lt\|exists> [value]` | `game` | ☑ | Assert a live runtime node property with a compact pass/fail response. Designed for generic QA, not a specific game. |
| `game qa discover [path]` | `game` | ☑ | List callable runtime `qa_*` helper methods on the current scene root, or on a specific node path. Returns compact method names, argument names, default counts, and return type when known. |
| `game qa --file <scenario.json> [--continue]` | local + tools | ☑ | Run a generic JSON QA scenario made of `run`, `stop`, `wait`, `game.node.get`, `game.node.set`, `game.node.call`, `game.qa.discover`, `game.ui.tree`, `game.click`, `game.input`, `game.input_log`, `game.assert`, `screenshot.runtime`, and `diagnostics` steps. `game.ui.tree` steps can pass `path`, `text`, and scoped `params` such as `type`, `fields`, and `depth` for low-token repeated reads. The file may be a legacy step array or an object with `requirements` plus `steps`; each step may declare `covers`, and missing or failed requirement coverage makes the scenario fail. |
| `guidance ui` | `guidance` | ☑ | Read the live editor's Game Feel UI Mode setting and return agent-facing UI implementation guidance. When enabled, UI work should favor snappy feedback, expressive state changes, satisfying motion, and runtime visual QA. |
| `guidance game-feel` | `guidance` | ☑ | Read the live editor's Game Feel Mode setting and return gameplay-wide feel guidance: control feel, camera, hit stop, screen shake, sound, particles, rewards, Honest Juice, accessibility, runtime QA, and report-derived `game_qa_patterns` for prompt-game implementation, including ordered state-changing QA, primary input validation, semantic-toggle safety, terminal-state messaging, live viewport layout, and focused helpers for deterministic events, delayed states, hidden-state preconditions, AI priority, collision, and wave/economy checks. |
| `game_feel [topic]` | `game_feel` | ☑ | Query the bundled Game Feel knowledge base. No topic or `list` returns the topic index; a topic such as `screen_shake`, `control_feel`, `camera`, `ui_bar`, or `ethics_checklist` returns concrete parameters and constraints. |
| `eval <expression>` | `eval` | ☑ | Evaluate one GDScript expression (`Expression` class, scene root as base) and return the result. |
| `instances` | local | ☑ | List all live Hera-enabled Godot editors discovered from `~/.hera-agent-godot/instances/`. |
| `screenshot [--path <p>] [--width N] [--height N] [--transparent] [--runtime] [--analyze]` | `screenshot` | ☑ | Render the edited scene off-screen to PNG, or capture the running game viewport with `--runtime`. `--analyze` is supported for runtime captures and returns generic image/layout metrics, including per-edge content ratios and possible clipping. |
| `batch [--file <p>] [--continue]` | `batch` | ☑ | Run a JSON array of `{tool, params}` (stdin or `--file`) in one request, sequentially, including async tools such as `game` and `screenshot`. |
| `smoke [--run-game\|--skip-game]` | local + tools | ☑ | Run a quick live-editor smoke check. `--run-game` also plays the current scene, checks `game tree`, captures/analyzes a runtime screenshot, then stops. |

> **Note (`run`):** use `project set-main-scene <res://scene.tscn>` when changing
> the main scene from Hera. Newly added scenes can still require a filesystem
> refresh or project reload before the editor resolves them as PackedScenes.
> After direct `.tscn` file edits, use `stop --wait`, `scene reload [res://...]`,
> then `scene save` so the live editor and disk file have a single synchronized
> writer.

> **Note (mutations):** `node add/instance/set/set-resource/remove`, `node attach-script/detach-script`,
> `scene open/reload/save/create/save-as`, `editor select/clear-selection`, `script open/create`, `resource set/create`, `project mkdir/scan/reimport`,
> `project set-main-scene`,
> `resource resave/update-uids/export-mesh-library`, and `signal connect/disconnect`
> are mutation commands and enforce the single-editor guard. Node and signal
> mutations register with the editor's undo history where Godot exposes UndoRedo;
> file, import, resource, scene, and project setting changes are persistent
> filesystem/project changes. `signal connect` uses `CONNECT_PERSIST`, so the wiring is saved with
> the scene like the editor's "Connect a Signal" dialog. `eval` runs a single
> expression via the `Expression` class (not full GDScript statements), with the
> edited scene root as the base instance. Expressions can call methods with side
> effects and are not registered with UndoRedo. `game node set/call`, `game click`, `game input`, and `game input-log --clear` target the
> running game process, so it is not undoable and its effects disappear when play
> stops. Hera assumes one live editor per project; mutation commands enforce that
> precondition unless `--instance <pid>` is passed explicitly.

## Global flags

Global flags go **before** the command (e.g. `hera-agent-godot --ids node find`,
`hera-agent-godot --instance 2840 node add Node2D`).

| Flag | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `--json` | ☑ | Pretty-print the response Data. |
| `--ids` | ☑ | Print only node paths (for `scene tree` / `node find`); compact JSON otherwise. |
| (default) | ☑ | Compact JSON — minimal tokens. |
| `--instance <pid>` | ☑ | Explicitly target an editor by pid (from `status`); also satisfies the single-editor mutation guard. Accepts `--instance N` or `--instance=N`. |
| `--timeout <ms>` | ☐ | Request timeout. |
